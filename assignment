Problem 1 : Consecutive Numbers

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select a.num as ConsecutiveNums from 
Logs a join Logs b on a.num = b.num join Logs c on b.num = c.num
where a.id = b.id - 1 and b.id = c.id - 1
group by a.num

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct a.num as ConsecutiveNums from 
Logs a join Logs b on a.num = b.num and a.id = b.id - 1 
join Logs c on b.num = c.num and b.id = c.id - 1

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct a.num as ConsecutiveNums from Logs a, Logs b, Logs c
where a.num = b.num and b.num = c.num
and a.id = b.id - 1 and a.id = c.id - 2

Problem 3 : User Activity

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select activity_date as day, count(distinct user_id) as active_users
from Activity;

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select activity_date as day, count(distinct user_id) as active_users
from Activity
where (activity_date > "2019-06-27" and activity_date <= "2019-07-27");

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select activity_date as day, count(distinct user_id) as active_users
from Activity
where (activity_date > "2019-06-27" and activity_date <= "2019-07-27")
group by activity_date;
